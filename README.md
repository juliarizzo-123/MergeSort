To allow a test user to run the MergeSort application on their machine, they should follow the following detailed steps. Ensure that the user has Java installed on their machine, as the code is written in Java.

Step 1: Code Preparation

The code you provided appears to be in a Java file named MergeSort.java. Make sure the user has this file on their machine or provide them with the source code.

Step 2: Code Compilation

Before running the program, the Java code needs to be compiled. This is done using the Java compiler (usually javac). Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the MergeSort.java file is located. Then, run the following command to compile the code:

bash
Copy code
javac MergeSort.java
This will create a file named MergeSort.class in the same directory.

Step 3: Running the Program

Now that the code has been successfully compiled, the user can execute the program. To do this, still in the terminal or command prompt, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
java MergeSort <list_of_numbers>

Replace <list_of_numbers> with the numbers the user wants to sort.
For example, if the user wants to sort the numbers 5, 2, 8, 1, 9, they should execute the following command:

java MergeSort 5 2 8 1 9

The program will run the MergeSort algorithm on the provided numbers and print the sorted list in the terminal.

Step 4: Observing the Results

After running the program, the numbers provided by the user will be sorted and displayed in the terminal. Ensure that the results are correct.

It's important to note that the provided code does not handle input errors, so the user should ensure they provide only integers as input. Otherwise, the program may generate exception errors.
